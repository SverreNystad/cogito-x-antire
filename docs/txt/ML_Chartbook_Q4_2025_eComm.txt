## Powering Up

<!-- image -->

January 2026 Q4 2025

In 2026, we believe the 'proud' bull market will power on into the next era of growth. This can be characterized by more normal returns driven by solid, double-digit earnings growth and a supportive economic backdrop, rather than the 'stampeding' bull we experienced from 2023 to 2025.

Four engines expected to fuel this developing growth cycle include:

- an acceleration of capital investment
- a continuation of quantitative easing and the build up of excess liquidity
- a resilient consumer
- a productivity wave centered around the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

These tailwinds, some of which are already in place, may rev-up more than expected as we move through the year.

We remind investors that volatility, especially during U.S. midterm election years, is normal and part of the investment process. This type of investment backdrop calls for portfolio diversification across and within asset classes with the ability to put dry pow d er to work during prospective market opportunities. We emphasize the importance of remaining invested, rather than trying to time the market.

## 4th Quarter Recap &amp; Major Index Total Returns

- Performance in 2025 reflected shifting fiscal policies, the reordering of global trade, and rapid AI advancements. Looking ahead to 2026, we expect equity markets and the global economy to remain in a transformational phase, with the bull market set to charge ahead. The U.S. remains our preferred region, supported by robust double-digit earnings growth, improving financial conditions, accelerating capital investments, and rising productivity levels driven by the ongoing digital infrastructure buildout.
- In the U.S., Large-caps led Small- and Mid-caps for the year, Growth-oriented Equities surpassed Value, and Global Equities outperformed broadly led by a resurgence in Emerging Markets. Fixed Income saw mid-single digit returns across most sub-asset classes as the Federal Reserve (Fed) reengaged in its interest rate cutting cycle. Commodities advanced in 2025, while Gold had its best year since 1979 amid shifting trade policy.
- BofA Global Research* expects stable global growth of 3.3% in 2026 and 3.4% in 2027, following an estimated 3.4% in 2025. U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an estimated 2.0% in 2025 but is projected to grow by 2.4% in 2026 and 2.1% in 2027, with China and the Euro area expected to grow by 4.7% and 1.0% in 2026 and 4.5% and 1.4% in 2027, respectively.

## Chief Investment Office's 7 Core Insights for 2026

<!-- image -->

Given all the below, we expect more of a proud bull in 2026 that powers on but doesn't stampede too far forward like the past three years. Portfolio diversification should prove its worth in risk management while core growth themes help boost returns. Our CIO portfolios continue to emphasize diversification and growth themes again in 2026 while we keep a keen eye on potential crosscurrents that may emerge.

<!-- image -->

Above-average economic growth expected driven by capital investment, fiscal tailwinds, and baby boomer spending.

<!-- image -->

Non-U.S. economic growth should be solid, namely driven by fiscal spending, global trade, capital investment, and real assets exposure.

<!-- image -->

Equities should trend higher in a 'proud bull' manner, driven by double-digit earnings growth for the S&amp;P 500.

<!-- image -->

U.S. equity valuations should remain elevated in 2026 but could be vulnerable to any negative growth shocks.

<!-- image -->

Capital market liquidity and easier financial conditions should be tailwinds in 2026.

<!-- image -->

We expect productivity to head another level higher which should underpin corporate margins.

<!-- image -->

The digital infrastructure buildout, global industrialization, power generation, experiential spending, automation/robotics, and biotechnology are all major themes.

## A Normalizing Economy

## Contributors to Real GDP Growth

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- The economy expanded by a seasonally adjusted annual growth rate of 4.3% in Q3. Growth was driven by increases in consumer spending, exports, and government spending.
- Consumption accounts for almost 70% of U.S. GDP. In Q3, consumer spending was broad-based, spanning both services and goods. On the other hand, there was a slight moderation in investment. Imports declined but played a smaller role in the overall picture compared to Q2.
- We remain constructive on the U.S. economy due to potential fiscal tailwinds for the consumer and corporation, easier monetary policy, and continued AI-related investment.

## CIO Key Considerations

We remain overweight the U.S. given solid earnings growth, strong balance sheets in aggregate, and relatively healthy consumer fundamentals.

## The Labor Market: A Static Environment

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- The U.S. labor market has cooled from its red-hot level following the pandemic. The unemployment rate has slowly been ticking up since mid-2025, reaching 4.6% in November 2025, its highest level since 2021.
- However, since 2021, the unemployment rate has stayed well below its long-term average of 5.7%.
- Amid weaker data, the Fed cut its policy rate by 25 basis points (bps) each in September, October, and December, suggesting support for the employment side of their mandate. For now, the labor market continues to be defined by a low turnover environment.

## CIO Key Considerations

Amid evolving labor market dynamics, we continue to view productivity-enhancing AI, robotics and automation as key themes.

Note: The BLS did not release an unemployment figure for October 2025. FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. Please refer to appendix for important disclosures.

<!-- image -->

## Inflation Remained Sticky in 2025

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Headline CPI inflation has been hovering in the 2% to 3% year-over-year (YoY) range for the last year and a half. In November, the core measure, which excludes volatile components like food and energy, eased to 2.6% YoY, its slowest pace since 2021.
- Prices are still above levels seen prepandemic; however, YoY inflation is well below historic highs. Inflationary pressures remained sticky throughout 2025.
- Affordability is likely to remain a theme in 2026. Meanwhile, a recent revival in core goods' contribution to inflation bears watching as tariff policy continues to filter through the economy.

## CIO Key Considerations

Well-diversified allocations with special attention to the inflation hedging properties of assets are important for long-term wealth accumulation in this environment.

Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Bloomberg. Data through November 2025, as of December 18, 2025. Latest data available. Note: The BLS did not collect survey data for October 2025 due to a lapse in appropriations amid the U.S. government shutdown. Additionally, BLS did not provide motor vehicle insurance data for November 2025. FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY . Please refer to appendix for asset class proxies and important disclosures.

## Two-Speed Consumer Remains Resilient in Aggregate

Lower-income households' spending growth was 0.6% YoY in November, compared to 2.6% YoY for higherincome peers

Total credit and debit card spending per household, according to Bank of America card data, by household income terciles (3-month moving average, YoY (%), seasonally adjusted)

<!-- image -->

- Spending trends in the U.S. continue to reflect large gaps between higher- and lower-income groups. This 'K-shaped' pattern was a key theme of consumer spending in 2025.
- One driver of the bifurcation in spending has been faster wage growth among higher-income households.
- Wealth effects have become more significant as retirees with a larger propensity to consume out of wealth comprise a greater share of the U.S. population.

## CIO Key Considerations

We expect consumption to remain resilient in aggregate in 2026, enabling solid economic growth.

Sources: Bank of America internal data, Bank of America Institute. Lower, middle and higher household income cuts in Bank of America credit and debit card spending per household, and consumer deposit account data are based on quantitative estimates of each households' income. These quantitative estimates are bucketed according to terciles, with a third of households placed in each tercile periodically. The lowest tercile represents 'lower income', the middle tercile represents 'middle income' and the highest tercile 'higher income'. The income thresholds between these terciles will move over time, reflecting any number of factors that impact income. Data through November 2025, as of December 10, 2025. Latest data available.

## Housing Market Still in Limbo

## Share of Total Outstanding Residential Mortgages by Mortgage Rate (%)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- While the 'lock-in' effect remains, the share of outstanding mortgages with mortgage rates above 6% has steadily risen in recent years as home buyers adjust to higher rates.
- Mortgage rates moderated in 2025 but remain elevated versus historical levels. A more substantial decline from here could boost activity among sidelined buyers.
- The path forward for mortgage rates will likely depend on the size and extent of additional rate cuts and the future of Mortgage-backed Securities (MBS) quantitative tightening, among other factors.

## CIO Key Considerations

A meaningful unfreezing of the U.S. housing market will hinge on lower interest rates.

## Moderate Dollar Depreciation, Not Outright Debasement

<!-- image -->

- The dollar entered last year at its most overvalued level since 1985 and its intentional devaluation via the 'Plaza Accord.' The dollar weakened against major currencies in 2025, primarily in the first half of the year.
- A recovery in relative U.S. growth expectations and moderating trade tensions could see the dollar return to favor among global investors.
- Past overvaluation, shifting trade dynamics, narrowing interest rate differentials, and central bank diversification efforts are likely to put moderate but contained downward pressure on the greenback.

## CIO Key Considerations

The U.S. remains the world's largest, wealthiest and most competitive economy, which should continue to drive investment in dollar-denominated U.S. assets.

## Growth is Key to Managing the U.S. Budget Deficit

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- The U.S. federal budget deficit reached $1.8 trillion in fiscal year (FY) 2025 or 5.9% of GDP. The deficit fell from 6.4% of GDP in FY 2024 but was still historically high given an economy at or near full employment.
- Interest payments, defense spending, and mandatory outlays remain structurally higher. Together, these categories made up 73% of outlays in FY 2025.*
- A solid economic backdrop, productivity gains from AI, tariff revenue, and lower interest rates could be tailwinds to government revenue in 2026.

## CIO Key Considerations

Healthy demand for U.S. government debt, the dollar's world reserve currency status, and strong economic growth are all reasons not to sweat the federal budget deficit in our view.

## Growth in China Continues to Decelerate Despite Equity Market Recovery

<!-- image -->

- China's equity market outperformed in 2025, along with emerging markets more broadly. Economic growth in China nonetheless continues to decelerate and is expected to fall further to 4.5% in 2026.*
- The traditional real estate investment growth engine remains in structural decline, with property prices still contracting on a YoY basis. This not only represents a persistent drag on fixed investment in China but also on household balance sheets and consumer spending.
- Despite these headwinds, ongoing expansion in the technology sector, elevated precious metals prices and to a lesser extent easier Fed policy are likely to remain supports for equity markets in the emerging world.

## CIO Key Considerations

The dominant economy in the emerging world, China, should see further deceleration in activity in 2026, but other tailwinds should continue to support EM equity returns.

## Mapping this Bull Market's Trajectory: How High? How Long?

<!-- image -->

- The S&amp;P 500 is up around 91% since October 2022, marking a resilient 3-year bull run despite volatility in 2025.
- We see continued upside supported by robust earnings, favorable financial conditions and structural megatrends in AI, automation, infrastructure, power generation, aerospace and defense, biotech and experiential spending.
- Comparing today's rally to 75 years of market history suggests this cycle could have more room to run and last years longer.
- Typical bull markets since 1949 have gained around 192% and lasted 5.5 years on average. Those bull market cycles that lasted beyond 3-years-like today-have historically delivered around 234% over nearly 7 years on average.

## CIO Key Considerations

We believe U.S. Equities remain well positioned for attractive returns over the long term. Given the U.S. market's exposure to transformative growth themes, we maintain an overweight stance and view pullbacks as opportunities to add exposure.

## Sector and Factor Performance Barometer

## Performance by S&amp;P 500 Index Sector

<!-- image -->

## Performance by Factor

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Despite pockets of weakness in Q4, all S&amp;P 500 sectors ended the year on a high note, bolstered by broader market participation and a resilient corporate profit cycle.
- In 2026, we anticipate fiscal stimulus, accommodative monetary policy, expanding capital expenditures, and a continuation of corporate earnings strength to propel the bull market.
- Investors can capitalize on current market dynamics while maintaining diversification across styles, regions, cyclical, and interest-rate sensitive sectors.

## CIO Key Considerations

Maintaining a balanced, diversified portfolio with exposure across cyclical industries, rate-sensitive and growth sectors remains a key priority during periods of heightened market volatility.

## U.S. Earnings Growth Remains a Major Pillar for Our Outlook

<!-- image -->

- Powering earnings growth in the U.S. has been a transition from a government spending-led expansion to one driven more by the private sector. A feature of this profits expansion has been its consistent outperformance versus expectations.
- We anticipate back-to-back years of double-digit earnings growth. In 2026, capital investment, resilient consumption driven by baby boomer spending, fiscal tailwinds, and productivity spurred by the ongoing innovation cycle should be supportive.
- Profits growth is likely to spread beyond just Technology, with all sectors expected to post positive earnings growth, implying a healthier foundation in 2026.

## CIO Key Considerations

Our constructive fundamental outlook is a key pillar within our overweight to U.S. Equities. We favor growth themes but are also inclined to broaden equity exposure.

- S&amp;P 500 EPS growth registered at 14% YoY in Q3 2025, marking the index's fourth straight quarter of double-digit growth. Profit margins continued to rise in 2025 despite tariff uncertainty.
- Under the index level, the five largest stocks contributed 41% of S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS) growth in Q3 2025. Earnings growth is positioned to be less concentrated in 2026 with double-digit growth expected in five of 11 sectors.
- Tax cuts and incentives related to new equipment and research and development in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) should help bolster corporate profits this year.

## CIO Key Considerations

We expect solid corporate earnings to be the primary driver of U.S. Equity returns in 2026 rather than multiple expansion.

- While absolute valuations across U.S. Equities are generally elevated, relative discounts can be found in areas like Smallcap and Value.
- These valuation differentials underscore the importance of maintaining exposure to both Large-caps and Small-caps, as well as Value and Growth, in long-term portfolios.
- Diversification across and within Equities will be imperative in 2026. That means maintaining a balance between playing offense, capturing potential market opportunities, and defense, reinforcing stability, in portfolios.

## CIO Key Considerations

We continue to emphasize the importance of maintaining well-diversified Equity exposure in portfolios.

## Stocks Lead the Way: Real Returns After Inflation

Average Annual Total Returns After Average Annual Inflation (%) 1978 - 2025*

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Since 1978, Equities have delivered annual total returns that have far exceeded the rate of inflation, on average.
- Bonds have also provided moderate returns after inflation, on average, while offering income and stability in portfolios.
- Meanwhile, cash has barely kept up with rising prices over the long-term. While it's essential that investors maintain appropriate levels of cash in portfolios, it shouldn't be viewed as a long-term investment.

## CIO Key Considerations

On average, Equities have historically generated relatively attractive returns after inflation. We maintain an Equity overweight in 2026.

## What Happens When the Fed Cuts?

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- The Fed resumed its 2024 interest rate cutting cycle by delivering three additional 25 bps cuts in 2025. Monetary policy is expected to ease further in 2026.
- History suggests that S&amp;P 500 returns during Fed easing cycles can depend heavily on the macroeconomic backdrop. Cycles without a recession have generally provided a more supportive environment for Equities.
- In 2025, interest rate cuts occurred when the S&amp;P 500 was hovering near all-time highs. When the Fed has cut interest rates within 2% of an all-time high since 1990, the S&amp;P 500 has returned an average of 11.2% one year later.*

## CIO Key Considerations

Fed interest rate cuts have historically had varied outcomes for Equities, with strong returns observed when cuts are not accompanied by a recession.

## A Dominance of Innovative Industries Returns More to U.S. Investors

<!-- image -->

- In the U.S., the leadership of innovative corporate sectors, such as Technology, has helped provide superior return-onequity (ROE) relative to other regions.
- Across the economy, the diffusion of artificial intelligence and related innovations may serve to further boost productivity, sustaining margins, ROE, and valuations overall.
- We believe this long-term trend is global in nature. ROE may also be supported by a nearer-term resilience in global economic growth.

## CIO Key Considerations

While we favor the U.S., we also emphasize disciplined diversification. This includes maintaining appropriate exposure to International Developed and Emerging Market Equities.

## A 'Dot-Com' Comparison: Amid Similarities, Key Differences Today

<!-- image -->

- Widely discussed have been similarities between recent market conditions and those during a prior period of excessive speculation-the Dot-com Era. Yet we see important differences.
- Back then, innovation-focused Equities appreciated well beyond the segment's earnings-generating capacity (shaded red), unlike today (shaded green). The Technology sector is currently one of the leaders of earnings growth for the S&amp;P 500.
- From a valuation perspective, back then, the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite P/E ratio fluctuated to above 90x. In 2025, its average stood at roughly 27x.

## CIO Key Considerations

We believe we are in a multiyear super cycle driven over the longer term by strong productivity gains from AI. Maintaining a high level of diversification during this buildout phase remains prudent.

## Taking Stock of Historical Market Leadership

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- The composition of leaders within the S&amp;P 500 differs substantially from decades prior.
- Sector-wise, Technology makes up nearly 35% of the S&amp;P 500. This share hovers near highs reached in 2000.*
- Concentration remains a reality of today's leadership, with the three largest companies in the S&amp;P 500 accounting for roughly one-fifth of the overall index.*

## CIO Key Considerations

Diversification helps investors protect against overexposure to one area of the market and mitigates portfolio concentration.

## Risk Monitor: Stickier, Higher Long-Term Global Interest Rates

Long-term rates have generally increased since 2022 and remain elevated even as the pace of inflation has eased. While greater global demand for investment may be a factor, greater fiscal uncertainty may be in play. After all, global sovereign debt currently sits at a record $105.8 trillion or some 46% higher than at the start of this decade.* Gross public debt as a share of GDP in advanced economies now stands at 111%, close to an all-time high.*

The Risk: Rising 30-year Sovereign Yields May Reflect Growing Fiscal Concerns.

Dec-25

## Equity Watch List

- Fiscal and monetary policy outlook
- Dollar movement and exposure to non-U.S. regions
- Pace of AI investment and competition
- U.S. Supreme Court decision on legality of tariffs under the IEEPA**
- Progression of earnings estimates
- Trajectory of global manufacturing

## Risk Considerations

- Softer-than-expected labor market and slower economic growth
- Potential for a pullback in high-income consumer spending
- AI momentum shift due to an earnings miss, supply shock, or tighter credit conditions
- Global fiscal concerns, as well as sticky inflation and its potential impact on the Fed's easing cycle
- Geopolitical uncertainty and heightened global protectionism measures

## Elevated U.S. Treasury Yields Remain Reasonably Attractive

<!-- image -->

- In the aftermath of the pandemic, U.S. Treasury yields have risen to their highest range in nearly two decades, reversing their secular downtrend since the 1980s.
- Risks of higher rates in the near term amid increasing deficits and debt levels remain limited, in our view, provided that the Fed does not re-emerge as a significant buyer of U.S. Treasurys to directly finance government deficits.
- Massively higher debt levels, when not financed by the Fed, have led to lower rates. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield peaked in 1980 when U.S. debt/GDP was 31%, with total U.S. Treasury supply less than $1 trillion. In the next four decades, Treasury rates fell and reached a secular low in 2020, even as the federal debt increased to &gt;$20 trillion, causing U.S. debt/GDP to hit 132%.

## CIO Key Considerations

The primary driver of long-term rates is the expected path of short-term rates, which are driven by Fed policy to manage inflation and employment. At current levels, rates are fairly priced, providing good diversification benefits for multi-asset class portfolios and reasonable income.

## The Power in Capturing Today's Elevated Yields

5-year Forward Annualized Total Returns

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- History suggests a strong and positive relationship between starting yields and subsequent forward total returns.
- Around 93% of 5-year annualized Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index total return can be explained by its starting yield.
- Simply put, the higher the entry yield, the stronger the forward return.
- With the Fed expected to continue easing in 2026, investors should consider moving investment cash to at least their strategic duration target to capture today's elevated yields and hedge against rates drifting lower ahead.

## CIO Key Considerations

We expect continued Fed easing in 2026 and, therefore, prefer investors to move excess cash into risk assets and Fixed Income of a reasonable duration.

## Credit Spreads Finish the Year Near Starting Levels

Investment Grade OAS (basis points)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Investment-grade (IG) credit spreads are ending the year where they began, while High Yield (HY) spreads are modestly wider.
- We are constructive on the macro and fundamental backdrops. However, we see modest technical pressures potentially leading to decompression in the first half.
- While room for further tightening may be more limited, we continue to believe that the current environment is supportive of credit spreads. We remain neutral both IG and HY.

## CIO Key Considerations

We continue to believe that neutral positioning across IG, HY, and MBS in all-Fixed Income portfolios is appropriate at this time.

## Q4 2025: Munis Continued to Rally After a Weak First Half

<!-- image -->

- Munis continued to rally on a relative and absolute basis, after a weak first half in which performance was adversely affected by concerns (which turned out to be overblown) on tariffs and the OBBBA.
- We are still constructive on tax-exempt munis because they remain an important solution for high income investors seeking to optimize after-tax returns.
- Muni valuations remain reasonably attractive; as of December 31, the Bloomberg U.S. Municipal Index yielded 3.60%, equivalent to 6.08% on a federal taxable basis for taxpayers in the highest marginal tax rate.
- We believe credit selection will remain an important determinant of municipal portfolio performance, to both exploit opportunities to enhance portfolio yield and avoid credit-related losses.

## CIO Key Considerations

For highly tax-sensitive investors, we maintain a preference for IG and High Yield tax-exempt securities over taxable bonds.

## Agency Mortgage-backed Securities: Balanced Outlook

<!-- image -->

- We maintain a neutral outlook for agency MBS within Fixed Income as risk-reward remains well-balanced.
- MBS delivered a strong performance in 2025 driven by market expectations of Fed policy rate easing and historically low-interest rate volatility. MBS Index spreads have broken through the low end of their three-year range leaving limited room for further spread compression.
- We continue to monitor two key developments: the Fed's MBS portfolio run-off and ongoing GovernmentSponsored Enterprises (GSE) privatization efforts, both of which could significantly impact performance.

## CIO Key Considerations

In multi-asset class portfolios, within IG Taxable, we are slightly underweight MBS in favor of Equities.

## Alternative Investments*: Delaying The Public Pivot

Count of PE-backed companies compared to publicly listed U.S. firms on the NYSE and Nasdaq

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Companies are enjoying the flexibility of staying private for longer. With access to plentiful private capital, more valuation growth is occurring before public ownership.
- With fewer burdensome reporting requirements (e.g., quarterly earnings), the universe of Private Equity (PE)- and Venture Capital (VC)-backed companies has grown from 2,600 to over 32,000, while the number of publicly listed companies has dwindled over the last 25 years.
- Following this trend, private markets are expected to be the birthplace of the next generation of technological firms that will drive the next leg of AI.

## CIO Key Considerations

Allocating to private markets allows qualified investors to access opportunities not available in public markets, potentially improving returns or increasing diversification.

## AI Era Drives Infrastructure Boom

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- The rapid acceleration of data center investments driven by the AI secular theme underscores a structural growth opportunity for strategic capital allocation within Infrastructure.
- As an asset class, Infrastructure can bring attractive attributes to portfolios including income, downside mitigation and hedging against inflation.
- Infrastructure can increasingly be accessed through both public and private markets, each offering differing exposures and riskand-return profiles.

## CIO Key Considerations

The infrastructure investment opportunity, in our view, is wide and deep. We continue to expect potential opportunities to develop in the coming years in both public and private markets.

- We maintain our Equity overweight relative to Fixed Income, while we continue to emphasize diversification, non-U.S. exposure with a slight bias toward emerging markets, above benchmark positioning in Financials, Utilities, Consumer Discretionary, and Industrials and benchmark exposure to Technology.
- Secular tailwinds may support Growth, while Value continues to trade at a relative discount and dividendoriented Value stocks remain attractive. We suggest a disciplined and balanced approach between Value and Growth for long-term investors.
- We are neutral across Fixed Income in all-Fixed Income low-tax sensitivity portfolios.  We still favor a significant allocation to bonds in a well-diversified portfolio.
- For qualified investors, we continue to emphasize potential long-term growth and income opportunities in Alternative Investments.

ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS NOTE: Given the differences in liquidity characteristics between Alternative Investments and traditional investments, the Alternative Investments portfolio positioning and CIO asset class views have been neutral rated versus our strategic allocations. These types of investments, in our opinion, should not be viewed at the asset class level on a tactical basis, rather the tactical positioning should be expressed at the subasset level.

## Patience Pays: Let Time Work for You

## S&amp;P 500: Frequency of Positive vs. Negative Annualized Total Returns Across Rolling Holding Periods

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- History shows longer holding periods increase the likelihood of positive returns. Over every 15- and 20-year rolling period since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 delivered a positive annualized total return-100% of the time.
- In other words, investors who stayed invested for 15+ years never experienced a negative average yearly return, even through recessions, wars, inflation, shocks and crises.
- Why? Short-term volatility tends to smooth out over time. Losses early in the period have been historically offset by recoveries and the power of compounding later.
- The key message is simple: markets may feel risky day-to-day, but the longer you stay invested, the more often you may experience gains. Time does not eliminate risk, but it has historically helped to shift the odds of success in your favor.

## CIO Key Considerations

Align investment horizons with goals. For long-term objectives, the historical probability of positive outcomes supports disciplined allocation and rebalancing.

## CIO Key Considerations

Secular bull markets are long-term uptrends in Equities that generally undergo multiple business and market cycles. We expect accelerated innovation in Artificial Intelligence and the asset-light era to power the ongoing secular bull market cycle forward.

## Time in the Market Matters

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Time in the market is a necessary ingredient for a successful investment strategy, as opposed to timing the market. In an attempt to invest at the 'perfect time', investors are likely to impair their returns.
- A longer investment horizon can be associated with an increased probability of generating positive returns.
- Since 1930, the S&amp;P 500 has returned over 31,814%, while the index has only returned 112% when you exclude the 10 best days per decade. Since the start of this decade, the index has returned 112% overall, but when you exclude the 10 best days that falls to 11%.*

## CIO Key Considerations

Excluding the best days of performance for the S&amp;P 500 has drastically cut down returns historically. Stay the course and remain invested according to an established investment plan.

## The Risk of Avoiding Risk

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Indiscriminately selling out of the market has the potential to influence long-term portfolio outcomes:
-  If you started out with a $100,000 Equity portfolio at the beginning of 2007, and you sold at the market bottom to invest in cash, you would only have around $63,000 today.
-  If you sold at the bottom and reinvested in Equities after one year (i.e., attempted to time the market), you would have about $404,000 today.
-  If you had stayed invested throughout the entire time frame, your initial investment of $100,000 would have grown to around $696,000 today.

## CIO Key Considerations

Staying invested throughout periods of uncertainty may help achieve better outcomes.

## CIO Thematic Investing: Spotlighting the Great Wealth Transfer

<!-- image -->

- Baby Boomers now own $85 trillion or more than half of U.S. household net worth. Some $105 trillion is expected to be inherited by members of Generation X, Millennials, and Generation Z through 2048 in the U.S.*
- Supported by appreciating Equities and home prices, boomer spending was a key driver of U.S. consumer resilience in 2025, a theme that we see continuing in 2026.
- The transfer of assets to the next generation of investors and consumers should mean greater demand for traditional stocks and bonds and alternative investments for qualified investors.

## CIO Key Considerations

Our themes of Transformative Innovation, Resilient Infrastructure, Future Security and Changing Demographics each carry long-term implications for economic growth, the cost of capital, and global earnings, in our view.

## Data Centers Are The New 'Power Players'

## Average hourly data center electricity demand  1

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Data center power demand could more than double within five years, concentrated in PJM* states (PA, NJ, MD, and more)-testing grid capacity and planning.
- In the U.S., data centers consume around 5% of electricity but may account for 35% of incremental demand through 2035. 2
- The race to build AI infrastructure faces critical constraints: securing grid connections, not just generating power. Transmission delays and interconnection queues can stall projects.

## CIO Key Considerations

Sustained load growth in the U.S., thanks in part to AI driven demand, creates a multifaceted investment opportunity. Consider in a thematic allocation: grid modernization and buildout, clean tech components, power electronics, energy efficiency solutions, renewable developers, and energy storage.

## Gold to Remain a 'Hedge' on Crosscurrents in 2026

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Gold's share of central bank reserves has surged in recent years, with the precious metal emerging as the second largest reserve asset globally. Central banks now hold around a fifth of all the gold that has ever been mined.
- In addition to strong buying from global central banks, drivers of gold's performance include structurally higher inflation, concerns of widening fiscal deficits globally, and ongoing geopolitical tensions.
- Structural tailwinds drove gold up 65% in 2025, its best year since 1979.

## CIO Key Considerations

Gold may provide diversification through bouts of market volatility and economic weakness or uncertainty.

## Volatility is Normal

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Remember that market volatility is normal and is an integral part of investing. Even years that culminate in positive returns overall can see notable intra-year drawdowns.
- Since 2000, annual returns for the S&amp;P 500 have always been greater than the max intra-year drawdown.
- Moreover, in the 3, 6, and 12-months after the S&amp;P 500 enters &gt;10% correction territory, the index has seen average forward returns of 5.6%, 11.0%, and 13.3%, respectively.*

## CIO Key Considerations

During volatile times, periods of weakness may provide attractive buying opportunities for investors to add to their investments.

<!-- image -->

- Our study indicates that a lump sum investing approach, which entails investing a sum of money all at once, typically has a higher likelihood of outperforming a Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) approach, which entails gradually investing a sum of money over time.
- However, a DCA approach may mitigate concerns of lump-sum investing during times of volatility, helping investors to deploy cash at regular intervals.

## CIO Key Considerations

We continue to emphasize the importance of adhering to a disciplined and consistent investment process.

Source: FactSet. Data as of December 31, 2025. Performance is calculated using a traditional 60/40 benchmark with the 60% equity allocation using the MSCI All Country World Index and the 40% fixed income allocation using the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index. Results are based on 1000 historical simulations. Each phase-in invests a fraction of the money each month. For example, in the 3-month phase-in, 1/3 of the money is invested the first month, another third the second month, so that all of the money is invested after 3 months. The time periods used were 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years. Each simulation would randomly pick 12, 36, or 60 months of returns from each benchmark and then calculate the returns over that time period using a 60%/40% equity/fixed income split that was rebalanced monthly. For each strategy and time period, the top and bottom bars show the maximum and minimum returns achieved across all simulations, while the middle box shows the median return. These performance results are not based on actual performance and are hypothetical simulations of a historical benchmark return. The returns shown are just one of the potential outcomes and using a different benchmark or time period will lead to different returns and results. These returns are purely for educational purposes and should not be viewed as realized returns or forecasts of portfolio performance. Cash returns for any uninvested cash are assumed to be 0%.

- In 2025, Equities staged a historic recovery from the nearly -19% drawdown in early April. The S&amp;P 500 ended the year up 38.6% from the April 8 low, registering an annual total return of 17.9%.
- The S&amp;P 500's 2025 annual return well exceeded the average annual total return of about 12% since 1928. It also marked the third consecutive year of double-digit gains for the index.
- We believe that the proud bull market marches on in 2026, though its advance could come at a moderate pace compared to the full-force charge over the past three years.

## CIO Key Considerations

In our view, the bull market could continue in 2026, with Equities well positioned to deliver attractive returns on an absolute and relative basis.

## Investment Strategy Committee Tactical Heat Map

- We remain overweight Equities relative to Fixed Income and continue to be balanced and diversified across all asset classes within multi-asset class portfolios.

- We are constructive on Fixed Income but remain underweight to fund our Equity overweight in diversified portfolios. We maintain a balanced approach across segments in all-Fixed Income low-tax- sensitive portfolios.

- Long-term investors that drift too far from their asset allocation objectives as market volatility picks up from time to time should consider rebalancing on weakness.

- Consumer spending growth remains firm as unemployment claims remain low, job openings are comfortable relative to unemployment, wage and salary growth has remained solid, and tariff uncertainty faded. GDP growth is tracking over 3% helped by strong consumer and business investment spending.
- Core personal consumption expenditures inflation has been stuck in a 2.5% to 3% range for over a year. Well-contained energy prices and housing price disinflation are helping to offset upward pressure from higher tariffs.
- Corporate profits are coming in strong fueled by the boom in AI spending and a pickup in global economic growth. Despite inching slightly lower, domestic profit margins remain around a 60-year high. The profit cycle is likely to be extended by tailwinds from fiscal stimulus and deregulation, all supportive of economic growth and risk assets. Equity market leadership, tight credit spreads, normalized volatility and a softening dollar from overvalued levels suggest solid growth ahead.

Investments discussed have varying degrees of risk. Some of the risks involved with equities include the possibility that the value of the stocks may fluctuate in response to events specific to the companies or markets, as well as economic, political or social events in the U.S. or abroad. Stocks of small- and mid-cap companies pose special risks, including possible illiquidity and greater price volatility than stocks of larger, more established companies. Bonds are subject to interest rate, inflation and credit risks. Investments in high-yield bonds ("junk bonds") may be subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss of income and principal than securities in higher rated categories. Income from investing in municipal bonds is generally exempt from Federal and state taxes for residents of the issuing state. While the interest income is tax-exempt, any capital gains distributed are taxable to the investor. Income for some investors may be subject to the Federal Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). Mortgage-backed securities are subject to credit risk and the risk that the mortgages will be prepaid, so that portfolio management may be faced with replenishing the portfolio in a possibly disadvantageous interest rate environment. Generally, when interest rates decline, prepayments accelerate beyond the initial pricing assumptions, which could cause the average life and expected maturity of the securities to shorten. Conversely, when interest rates rise, prepayments slow down beyond the initial pricing assumptions and could cause the average life and expected maturity of the securities to extend and the market value to decline. Investments in foreign securities involve special risks, including foreign currency risk and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risk are magnified for investments made in emerging market. Investments in a certain industry or sector may pose additional risk due to lack of diversification and sector concentration. Investments in real estate securities can be subject to fluctuations in the value of the underlying properties, the effect of economic conditions on real estate values, changes in interest rates, and risk related to renting properties, such as rental defaults. There are special risks associated with an investment in commodities, including market price fluctuations, regulatory change, interest rate change, credit risk, economic changes and the impact of adverse political or financial factors.

Investing in Gold involves special risks, including market price fluctuations, regulatory changes, interest rate changes, credit risk, economic changes, and the impact of adverse political or financial factors.

Investments in Infrastructure Assets will be subject to risks incidental to owning and operating infrastructure projects, including risks associated with the general economic climate, geographic or market concentration, government regulations and fluctuations in interest rates. The industries targeted for investment may be highly regulated by governmental agencies. Such regulations may impact an investor's ability to acquire, dispose of and/or manage investments.

## Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.

There may be conflicts of interest relating to the alternative investment and its service providers, including Bank of America Corporation, and its affiliates, who are engaged in businesses and have clear interests other than that of managing, distributing and otherwise providing services to the alternative investment. These activities and interests include potential multiple advisory, transactional and financial and other interests in securities and instruments that may purchase or sell such securities and instruments. These are considerations of which investors in the alternative investments should be aware.  Additional information relating to these conflicts is set forth in the offering materials for the alternative investment.

Alternative investments are intended for qualified investors only. Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk.

Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, fine art, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value. Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity. Nonfinancial assets are not in the best interest of all investors. Clients should always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.

Investors should bear in mind that the global financial markets are subject to periods of extraordinary disruption and distress. During the financial crisis of 2008-2009, many private investment funds  incurred significant or even total losses, suspended redemptions or otherwise severely restricted investor liquidity, including increasing the notice period required for redemptions, instituting gates on the percentage of fund interests that could be redeemed in any given period and creating side-pockets and special purpose vehicles to hold illiquid securities as they are liquidated. Other funds may take similar steps in the future to prevent forced liquidation of their portfolios into a distressed market. In addition, investment funds implementing alternative investment strategies are subject to the risk of ruin and may become illiquid under a variety of circumstances, irrespective of general market conditions.
