## We visited Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on 12/15, and met with several executives across multiple business

divisions. While these meetings were 1 month ago, we believe our takeaways are longer term in nature, including: 1) Microsoft's intense focus on fungibility to manage through the AI compute cycle in both periods of supply constraints and potentially excess supply, and to mitigate customer concentration risk; 2) Microsoft's intense focus on capacity planning that allows it to dynamically allocate compute across Azure customers, internal R&amp;D and 1P apps; 3) Microsoft's gross margin advantage via its partnership with OpenAI (such that it can leverage models without paying additional LLM API fees) and its potential to abstract LLM value into an orchestration layer; and 4) an evolution in enterprise conversations that are more supportive of Copilot adoption today vs. a year ago. We are positive on the stock as we continue to view Microsoft as best positioned in our coverage universe to bene fi t from compounding AI product cycles with a path to ~$35 in EPS in FY30 (ends June 2030), implying &gt;20% EPS growth. Please also see our Microsoft initiation here.

## Key Takeaways

## 1) Microsoft expects AI margins to improve over time and sees

margin expansion potential in core cloud: Management frames Azure gross margins through two lenses: 1) classic cloud, and 2) with AI. For Azure ex. AI, Microsoft believes that margins can continue to expand with scale, e ffi ciency gains, and cost optimization, even with passing price downs partly on to customers and server refresh cycles. For Azure with AI, Microsoft sees parallels between the AI cycle and the early stages of the cloud cycle, characterized initially by elevated costs and weak unit economics but improving with scale, utilization, and engineering e ffi ciency. In the cloud transition, Microsoft set a medium-term gross margin target with annual

targets and was within 100bps of their target each year. Relative to the cloud cycle, Microsoft believes it has more of a leadership position in the AI cycle such that it can de fi ne the art of the possible. This includes leveraging deep engineering and operational knowledge of over the years of managing silicon and software layers to deliver such operating discipline, and a team that meets very frequently to with a maniacal focus on capacity decisions and cost levers. Microsoft emphasized that the current AI cycle is characterized by far greater operational urgency and integration across business divisions (Cloud, O ffi ce, etc.). As an example, Microsoft identi fi ed an ine ffi cient element in a model that was more compute-intensive than initially expected and, over the course of a single weekend, delivered an optimization solution that would have otherwise taken 2-3 months in the prior cloud era.

- 2) The role of LLMs: Microsoft drew parallels between the abstraction of the technology stack in the cloud vs. AI cycle. VMs abstracted hardware and containers abstracted much of the OS, simplifying deployment and improving long-term unit economics. Similarly, Microsoft sees LLMs as the next abstraction layer, abstracting application logic itself. Rather than hard-coding rules and work fl ows, applications are moving toward intent-driven execution, with models handling the reasoning and orchestration. Today, Microsoft believes focus is overly weighted on the absolute higher headline cost of new models (e.g., ChatGPT 5.2 vs. 5.1). However, next generation models are designed in a much more e ffi cient manner with improving token e ffi ciency. Today, the performance bene fi t of new models is passed to end users in almost every instance due to competition. In the future, models may balance between passing cost downs to the end user and delivering margins to shareholders. We believe the key swing factor will be the degree to which LLMs are di ff erentiated vs. commoditized.
2. Foundry has an opportunity to abstract LLMs: Foundry has an opportunity to n become the abstraction layer for LLMs by sitting between applications and individual models, acting as the arbitrator or control plane for routing, governance, and cost optimization. While AI workloads are compute-intensive today, Microsoft believes that declining token costs, e ffi ciency gains, and model commonality over time will allow a greater share of value to accrue to the platform layers. Eventually, LLM-related COGS and gross margin tax may become de minimus. Currently, Microsoft having IP rights to OpenAI models has allowed the company to incur no

gross margin tax from API calls, which we view as a competitive advantage vs. other software providers.

3) How Microsoft thinks through Azure build out: Microsoft frames Azure build out through a supply-demand lens, with di ff erent monetization pro fi les across workloads. When forecasting, Microsoft buckets commitments by customer size and compute type, noting that GPU-driven AI workloads tend to monetize immediately once capacity comes online, creating step-function growth tied directly to deployment timing. In contrast, traditional CPU and non-AI workloads historically exhibited smoother consumption curves, as supply closely matched demand, and consumption curve was a function of customers progressing from POCs to production over time. For CPU and storage that is now explicitly tied to AI use cases, even these categories are beginning to show lumpier, step-like consumption trends. Even in a supply constrained environment, where Microsoft has some pricing leverage, there are still competitive dynamics at play for the largest customers.

- Mix of training vs. inference: The mix of training vs. inference is an important n determinant of overall consumption patterns. Training workloads tend to be episodic and intensive while inference is more persistent and scales over time. Management noted that there is a large part of the training market that Microsoft does not compete in. Instead, the company is making strategic bets on both training and downstream value creation through inference. As customer use cases and hardware capabilities evolve, workloads will also evolve from their initial use cases. Thus, fungibility is crucial in reducing utilization risk and supporting changing demand pro fi les. The company has already seen cases today where they are able to fl ip capacity from training to inferencing. Microsoft has visibility into whether customers are utilizing GPUs for training or inferencing based on infrastructure-level usage patterns. From initial deployment, the company works with customers not only to optimize GPU usage but also from a networking standpoint.
- Considerations in a non-supply constraint environment: In an environment where n supply is not constrained, Microsoft would approach Azure capacity planning as a portfolio-level decision rather than a standalone Azure exercise, aggregating demand signals across Azure, M365, D365, internal R&amp;D and model training

workloads. There needs to be high conviction across a set of parameters for the company to pursue capacity deployment. Factors that would change this level of con fi dence include: model roadmap, expected customer value, price-performance, performance on Microsoft's hardware, agentic work fl ow adoption, enterprise roadmap for adopting the technology. For the largest customers, this can create step function increases in capacity requirements across regions and SKUs, in which case Microsoft also evaluates regional demand, digital sovereignty requirements, and regulatory constraints.

- Managing build-out and oversupply risk for the long term: Given that many n contracts with frontier model developers are multi year in nature and carry demand uncertainty over extended time horizons, Microsoft mitigates risk by prioritizing fl eet-level fungibility. This approach allows the same infrastructure to support not only external customer workloads but also demand across Microsoft's ecosystem, including M365, Github, Dynamics, and Bing. This fl exibility enables Azure to absorb customer demand variability while preserving utilization, and capital commitments are made selectively to workloads and contracts that align with Microsoft's long-term strategy and economic interests.

## 4) BYOC (bring-your-own chip) is not economically attractive for Microsoft:

Management does not view BYOC as economically compelling or strategically advantageous for Microsoft. BYOC silos portions of the infrastructure stack and undermines the core e ffi ciency levers that drive cloud margins: scale purchasing, full-stack integration and end-to-end optimization. Microsoft's margin advantage accrues through optimizing across the data center, power and cooling, networking, and silicon layers, rather than at any single component of the stack. Fragmenting the silicon component thus weakens system-level e ffi ciencies and reduces performance and pricing power. Microsoft acknowledged that in some select cases for the top 2-3 frontier models, it could make sense to shift upfront capital investment and duration risk to the customer. However, for the vast majority of customers, Microsoft's procurement and balance sheet advantages allow it to source and o ff er essentially any required chip architecture (ex. TPUs) or capability without customers bearing upfront chip acquisition costs or complex SLAs. Consistent with this view, Microsoft's recently announced

partnership with Anthropic did not involve a BYOC arrangement. Broadly on o ffl oading the risks of managing silicon to the customer, Microsoft already manages this risk with contract duration and decades of experience managing silicon lifecycles. Further, silicon lifetimes have proven more durable than initially assumed; e.g., Microsoft is able to sell fully-depreciated H100s to new customers.

5) Fungibility underpins Microsoft's infrastructure strategy: Microsoft's infrastructure strategy is anchored to maintaining fungibility for as long as practically possible across demand planning, data center design, and 'late binding' in the supply chain. This concept of fungibility includes deferring design and deployment decisions to the last feasible point in order to preserve fl exibility as demand signals and technology evolve. This principle shaped the company's data center architecture, which has evolved further in the last year. For example, newer designs such as Fairwater employ two-story structures and 3D rack layouts to shorten cable and pipe runs, reducing latency and improving bandwidth between GPUs to maximize performance. More broadly, Microsoft standardizes network fl eet typologies while accommodating both liquid and air cooling, engineering these modes to be operationally similar. Microsoft is willing to accept modest e ffi ciency trade o ff s, such as foregoing incremental performance gains from bespoke cooling or chip-speci fi c designs, in exchange for greater capital agility and fungibility across workloads and silicon.

6) MAI roadmap and OpenAI IP: Microsoft frames MAI as complementary to its strategic partnership with OpenAI. With access to IP generated by OpenAI through 2032 (as of October 2025 agreement), Microsoft's MAI investments will focus on building forked, fi ne-tuned, and specialized variants of OpenAI models using Microsoft's proprietary, domain-speci fi c data, with deep integration across its application ecosystem (e.g., Copilot). Examples thus far include MAI-Voice-1 and MAI-Image-1, purpose-built speech and image models deployed within Copilot and Bing Image Creator. MAI is intended to selectively develop fi rst-party models for targeted workloads and use cases that can drive user engagement, product di ff erentiation, and monetization across Microsoft's portfolio. Investment decisions are anchored in clear business and product outcomes to avoid funding science experiments or research projects.

7) Enterprise AI adoption and the evolution of 'DIY' vs. packaged: Microsoft observed that relative to last year, customer Copilot conversations have moved from a discussion around ROI and 'if' there will be adoption, to a conversation that is more focused on 'when' and to what degree there will be adoption. At the same time, Microsoft noted less uncertainty in its budget conversations, compared to last 4QCY where customers often ended the year with surplus budget to protect against unknown macro factors. Microsoft noted uncertainty is the hardest budget environment to sell into; when budget is good, Microsoft operates from a position of strength; when budget is weak, Microsoft tends to outperform peers because of productivity gains tied to its platform approach.

- Enterprise AI Adoption: Microsoft indicated that enterprise AI adoption is already n broad, with a growing number of customers using AI in some form and accelerating usage intensity within that base. For Copilot speci fi cally, Microsoft sees customers expand deployments from a few hundred to several thousand licenses as familiarity with the product's capabilities increases. Adoption typically follows a

- land-and-expand motion, with customers piloting at smaller scale before broadening usage.
- On Copilot pricing , Microsoft utilizes a value-based approach that examines n customers' willingness to pay and the incremental value bene fi t relative to existing spend. Management assessed early adoption and usage patterns, initially optimizing for a higher price. To broaden top-of-funnel adoption, Microsoft introduced a lower-priced business SKU at $21 / user, with expectations that pricing SKUs will further diversify over time as use cases mature. Monetization is centered on feature expansion and consumption, with a long-term goal of delivering value that supports pricing above $30 / user. Productivity gains to date have varied by function and use case, with early bene fi ts largely re fl ecting faster task completion rather than immediate cost savings. Internally, Microsoft is seeing the strongest traction in customer support functions, where improvements in time-to-resolution can translate more directly into budget savings.
- DIY software vs. building on Microsoft's platform: On building agents in house vs. n on Microsoft's platform, Management looks to monetize both approaches and expect them to coexist, though it is too early to determine which share will ultimately be larger. While many customers initially build agents internally, Microsoft believes complexities will compound over time as customers must maintain models, manage updates, and establish reliable connectors. These operational hurdles underpin Microsoft's value proposition, positioning the company as a long-term partner to help customers manage, scale, and sustain AI-driven solutions. Our industry work suggests that the pendulum may began to swing back to packaged software as the ecosystem matures.
- Updates in GTM: Microsoft's sales incentives for Copilot have shifted from an initial n focus on pricing, to driving deployment and realized value. When launched, customer conversations centered around price and ROI. Microsoft observations suggest that even modest daily usage delivers ROI to justify full license. As adoption broadened beyond early adopters, incentives are now aligned toward accelerating time-to-value. This includes reducing deployment friction with forward deployed engineers (we believe Microsoft's investment here has grown), simplifying complex customer environments, and building greater integration across tools.

launch of Claude Cowork, a version of its Code tool with a user interface designed for non-coders. While Claude Cowork was not available at the time of our December meeting with Microsoft, we believe the question will be to what extent Microsoft can maintain a moat because of its entrenchment in existing knowledge worker work fl ows such that the quality of outputs from Copilot exceed or are di ff erentiated from the quality of outputs from third party tools that may have more surface level integrations into the Microsoft ecosystem.

## Valuation &amp; Key Risks

We maintain our Buy rating and 12-month price target of $655, based on a 32x P/E multiple to Microsoft's SNTM adjusted net income. Key downside risks include: less-than-expected revenue contribution from OpenAI partnership, longer ramp for internal silicon which can limit market share gains or gross margin expansion, greater investments in projects outside of expectations (e.g., non-Azure), key leadership changes, and more meaningful shift to custom software that could negatively impact its applications business.

## GS Factor Pro fi le

The Goldman Sachs Factor Pro fi le provides investment context for a stock by comparing key attributes to the market (i.e. our universe of rated stocks) and its sector peers. The four key attributes depicted are: Growth, Financial Returns, Multiple (e.g. valuation) and Integrated (a composite of Growth, Financial Returns and Multiple). Growth, Financial Returns and Multiple are calculated by using normalized ranks for speci fi c metrics for each stock. The normalized ranks for the metrics are then averaged and converted into percentiles for the relevant attribute. The precise calculation of each metric may vary depending on the fi scal year, industry and region, but the standard approach is as follows:

Growth is based on a stock's forward-looking sales growth, EBITDA growth and EPS growth (for fi nancial stocks, only EPS and sales growth), with a higher percentile indicating a higher growth company. Financial Returns is based on a stock's forward-looking ROE, ROCE and CROCI (for fi nancial stocks, only ROE), with a higher percentile indicating a company with higher fi nancial returns. Multiple is based on a stock's forward-looking P/E, P/B, price/dividend (P/D), EV/EBITDA, EV/FCF and EV/Debt Adjusted Cash Flow (DACF) (for fi nancial stocks, only P/E, P/B and P/D), with a higher percentile indicating a stock trading at a higher multiple. The Integrated percentile is calculated as the average of the Growth percentile, Financial Returns percentile and (100% - Multiple percentile).

Financial Returns and Multiple use the Goldman Sachs analyst forecasts at the fi scal year-end at least three quarters in the future. Growth uses inputs for the fi scal year at least seven quarters in the future compared with the year at least three quarters in the future (on a per-share basis for all metrics).

For a more detailed description of how we calculate the GS Factor Pro fi le, please contact your GS representative.

## M&amp;A Rank

Across our global coverage, we examine stocks using an M&amp;A framework, considering both qualitative factors and quantitative factors (which may vary across sectors and regions) to incorporate the potential that certain companies could be acquired. We then assign a M&amp;A rank as a means of scoring companies under our rated coverage from 1 to 3, with 1 representing high (30%-50%) probability of the company becoming an acquisition target, 2 representing medium (15%-30%) probability and 3 representing low (0%-15%) probability. For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&amp;A component into our target price. M&amp;A rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not factor into our price target, and may or may not be discussed in research.

## Ratings, coverage universe and related de fi nitions

Buy (B), Neutral (N), Sell (S) Analysts recommend stocks as Buys or Sells for inclusion on various regional Investment Lists. Being assigned a Buy or Sell on an Investment List is determined by a stock's total return potential relative to its coverage universe. Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on an Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a  stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Early-Stage Biotech, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed Neutral. Each region manages Regional Conviction Lists, which are selected from Buy rated stocks on the respective region's Investment Lists and represent investment recommendations focused on the size of the total return potential and/or the likelihood of the realization of the return across their respective areas of coverage.  The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction Lists are managed by the Investment Review Committee or other designated committee in each respective region and do not represent a change in the analysts' investment rating for such stocks.

Total return potential represents the upside or downside di ff erential between the current share price and the price target, including all paid or anticipated dividends, expected during the time horizon associated with the price target. Price targets are required for all covered stocks. The total return potential, price target and associated time horizon are stated in each report adding or reiterating an Investment List membership.

Coverage Universe: A list of all stocks in each coverage universe is available by primary analyst, stock and coverage universe at

.

Not Rated (NR). The investment rating, target price and earnings estimates (where relevant) are removed pursuant to Goldman Sachs policy when Goldman Sachs is acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or in a strategic transaction involving this company, when there are legal, regulatory or policy constraints due to Goldman Sachs' involvement in a transaction, and in certain other circumstances. Early-Stage Biotech (ES). An investment rating and a target price are not assigned pursuant to Goldman Sachs policy when this company neither has a drug, treatment or medical device that has passed a Phase II clinical trial nor a license to distribute a post-Phase II drug, treatment or medical device. Rating Suspended (RS). Goldman Sachs Research has suspended the investment rating and price target for this stock, because there is not a su ffi cient fundamental basis for determining an investment rating or target price. The previous investment rating and target price, if any, are no longer in e ff ect for this stock and should not be relied upon. Coverage Suspended (CS). Goldman Sachs has suspended coverage of this company. Not Covered (NC). Goldman Sachs does not cover this company.
